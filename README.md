# Trackmania 2020 Guide (WIP)
This repo aims to be a info-hub for all trackmania tricks and mechanics. It'll explain to the user how to do every trick in the game, what are the nuances of every mechanics etc. WIP

Gear shift happens at different speeds when you are speed sliding. 4th gear happens at 222 instead of 235. 5th gear happens at 314 instead of 342. You don't want to shift gears while ur speed sliding try to straighten the car out before you shift gears then start speed sliding again

# General
This section will describe the mechanics and tricks that can be utilized at all times regardless of surface type.
## Airtime
More time on the ground = more time accelerating. Reduce airtime where possible. 
Generally it's adviced hold throttle while in the air since this makes you move the fastest through the air.

**How to reduce airtime**:
1. Slow down right before the jump. (fastest)
2. Let go of the throttle while already in the air. This will slow you down and make you touch the ground sooner.
3. Hold brake while in the air. This slows you down even more but also gets you to the ground even quicker.

There is no 1 trick fits all when it comes to airtime, sometimes it's faster to only do option 2 followed by 3 to gain some extra control. Sometimes you'll just have to use 2. It all depense on the speed you have, how steep the jump is, what your landing environment looks like. I'll try to include some examples of different scenarios.

### Airbraking
There are 2 types of airbraking:

1. Holding brake (like described above)
2. Tapping brake (a ***brake-tap***)

Both will stop your car from rotating in the air (in every axis) but only a brake-tap allows you to do this without losing a noticeable amount of speed.
The shorter the brake-tap to more speed you preserve.

You'll want to stop your rotation in the air to line your car up with the surface that you're landing on. The more parallel to the ground you can land, the more stable your landing will be. 
Sometimes you'll want your car in a specific angle to make your tires touch the ground just a tat sooner but this is a bit more risky to do and not always required.

Examples:
![brake-tap]()
![hold brake]()

### Countersteering
Stops your car from rotating in the air.
Steer in the oposite direction that the car is rotating in.
The happens more gradually compared to air-braking.

Examples:
![jump stop rotation roll]()
![jump stop rotation yaw]()
![stop rotation by countersteer vs air-brake]()

**Exceptions**:
//TODO: add exceptions for brake-taps and hold brake

# Tricks per surface type
## Lines

* Road: Reduce the number of meters traveled. Stay as close to inner corners as possible even when this means releasing a bit before the corners (see example nr. PLACEHOLDERTEXT)
* Dirt: Wider lines are often preffered. The less you angle your car when driving, the more speed you can preserve. Therefore, smoothness over distance traveled.
* Gras: Same as dirt. 

## Ice
The most slippery surface in the game.
### Ice Slides
Gives you a gigantic acceleration boost.
#### **Basics**
Start an ice-slide by rotating the car 90 degrees, then counter steer, all while still holding your throttle. You'll notice immediately when you get it.
![without iceslide]()
![with iceslide]()
#### **Intermediate**
You probably noticed that you don't have much control over the exact angle that you're turning at and that starting/exiting an ice-slide can be awkward at times. Well here are some tricks to help you with that..

##### **Entering and exiting an ice-slide**
1. When starting an ice-slide, let go of your throttle while doing the rotation movement. This will make the car rotate faster at the cost of a little bit of speed. This trade-off is worth it most of the time because you can start the ice-slide sooner.
2. When exiting an ice-slide, do the same as in 1. This makes you to come out of an ice-slide quicker and allows you to straignten out your car faster.

##### **Adjusting your angle**
1. Brake while still holding throttle. When the brake button is pressed the car will rotate more inwards resulting in a tighter turn.
   1. Brake-tap: Most of the time what you'll want to do is tap brake multiple times to adjust your angle.
   2. Hold brake: Only hold brake for large corrections or for the tightest of turns. Try to not slow down so much that you start gearing down, this will make you lose control of the car if you're not careful.

![ice brake-tap, not tight enough, too tight, perfect]()
![ice hold brake 3-way view like above]()

1. Brake without holding throttle
   1. //TODO: what does this do?

2. Let go of throttle briefly then press throttle again. This will result in a wider turn since your car will exit the ice-slide temporarily and just slide instead.
   1. Just like with brake-taps it's best to release very briefly but multiple times to adjust your angle. Don't release throttle for too long or you'll risk sliding out.

![ice no throttle long]()
![ice no throttle short]()


**For controller**: I recommend that you bind brake to something else than a trigger. This will allow you to press the button extremely shortly. Personnaly I use the x button (playstation) for this.
### Bobsleigh
#### **Basics**
Approach the turns in a way so that the car transitions smoothly to between the red lines. **The smoother the better.**
When you're just starting out on this surface try to not focus on getting between the red lines as quickly as possible, try to do it as smoothly as possible. The control to get between the red lines faster comes later.

#### **Advanced**
1. When you're already driving between the lines rotate your wheels 84%. It is considered cheating to make a custom key that steers at exactly that angle so the next best thing is action key 4 (80%) or trying to hold 84% with an analog device.
2. You can technically do ice wiggles in bobsleigh turns. Incredibly inconsistent, very high risk of slowdown or even completely spinning out. Don't do it, reserved for extremely pro players who want to set a one-time record and the clinically insane.

### Ice Wiggles
Gives your car extra speed compared to driving straight on a straight section of ice.

#### **Basics**
Don't make this your priority, train the other stuff.

#### **Advanced**
//TODO: https://youtu.be/ttn1PDAdkRo?t=73

Since the [last update](https://www.trackmania.com/news/7126). Ice wiggles are very difficult to pull off,speed gain is minor and on top of that, it gives you a major speed penalty if you miss the ideal timing.
* < 200 speed: Drive straight
* \> 200 speed: Wiggle, but don't if you can't do it consistently. The speed gain is minor and not worth the risk if you can't do is consistently.

How to perform an Ice wiggle:

## Plastic
The second most slipery surface of the game.

## Gras
More slippery than dirt, less than plastic.
